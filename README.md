# Vision
The Open Source 3D Initiative was created to support citizen scientists by carving out a portion of the 3D frontier to ensure open access to high quality primitives.

# Mission
In the broadest sense possible, the mission of this initiative is to create a framework for driving community research that relies whooly or in part on 3D manufacturing. The initial focus of the Open Source 3D Initiative will be in the domain of agricultural based infrastructure and associated automation. The intent is to enable direct research into the optimization of food-production systems from the perspectives of: lighting, growing conditions research, water and mineral management.

If you are interested in supporting these or related activities, please consider: following, sharing, contributing or becoming a sponsor.
